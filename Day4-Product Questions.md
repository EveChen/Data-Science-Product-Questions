# Product Questions - Insurance

### Q1: Issue 一個 life insurance product 時需要考慮什麼因素?
#### My Answer: 
* Company Perspective: How much? What's the premium (保費)? Compare with other competitors/products
* Customer Perspective: How to promote? (Marketing) What's the customer base/size/target? Individual policy vs group policy?
* 補充: death rate, term, operation cost, payment schedule, cash lump sum (die before/after)
* 專業術語: mortality rate (越高代表壽命越短，保險公司能夠投資的時間相對較短、return較低), morbidity rate(越高代表此人越容易生病、死亡), medical screening questionnaire (some serious health conditions would result in disqualification)

### Q2: 如果硬要issue給高death rate 的人，你有啥建議to make profit?
#### My Answer: 
* Company Perspective: Increase the insurance premiums, comparative low cash lump sum 
* Customer Perspective: Encourage these people to build healthy habits to reduce their morbidity rate. For example, charge a higher premium for smokers than for non-smokers. If someone quit smoking and has not smoked in several years, he/she can qualify for the lower premium as a non-smoker.

### Q3: 什麼因素衡量app是否值得發佈?
#### My Answer: 
* Profit Perspective: If our business model is to earn profits from the app itself, then we need to take the revenue & cost into consideration. That is, if the profits are positive, then we will be more likely to issue this app.
* Promotion Perspective: If the reason why we issue this app is to promote our other products, then we care about if the app can reach to our target customers. 


### Q4: 給了#users, download price, in -app purchase per user, Ad rev per user, cost..將近10行的數據吧，2組產品free 和 paid的，問哪個更盈利?
#### My Answer: 用 Revenue & Cost 去算，例如 free app 的 revenue 來自於 users x (ad rev per user + in-app purchase per user)，再減去 cost 像是 operation cost 去算 profits.

### Q5: 如果要同時發佈兩個產品，會發生什麼?
#### My Answer: 假設 Q4 的答案是 paid app 比 free app 更 profitable，但消費者比較喜歡 free app，則
* Short-term: 我認為發佈初期 free app 下載量會比 paid app 來得多，使得 free app 更 profitable (e.g. 有較多廣告收益)
* Long-term: 透過 free app 的宣傳，paid app 得到更多曝光度，亦或者消費者在長期使用 free app 後想升級，使得購買 paid app人增加

### Q6: 如果同時發佈，問多少user從paid APP flow 到free app才break even， 這個計算的假設是什麼?
#### My Answer: I have no idea 
##### --> 查查看 break even point = 固定總成本 / (單位產品價格 - 單位變動成本)。
Is this question about free-to-paid conversion?
